# Hellcat Ransomware ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

This project is a mini ransomware demonstration to understand the operation of this type of malware. It was created as part of a school project to present during an Open Day.

The main features of the script include:

1. **RSA Key Pair Generation**: The script generates an RSA key pair (public key and private key) to encrypt and decrypt files.

2. **File Encryption**: The script encrypts all files in the "exemple_dir" directory (at the root of the project) using the previously generated public key.

3. **File Decryption**: The script decrypts all files in the "exemple_dir" directory (at the root of the project) using the previously generated private key.

4. **Display of a tkinter Window**: The script displays a tkinter window with a ransom message.

**Disclaimer**: This project was created for educational purposes and should not be used for malicious intent. The authors will not be held responsible for any damage caused by users of this script.
